                <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

                <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study
                as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

            <section>
                <section id="Citas">
                    <h4>Starting dates</h4>
                    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however, it would suit
                        us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as
                        follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First semester: <time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</li>
                        <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></li>
                        <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Please let me know if this is okay, and if so, which start date you would prefer.</p>
                    <p>You can find more information about important university dates on our <a

                        <h4>Subjects of study</h4>
                        <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as
                            the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an
                            intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our
                            team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in
                            order of priority:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Turning H<samll>2</samll>O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C<small>14</small>H<small>12O3</small>.)</li>
                            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures exceeding 30°C
                                (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10^3 > 3 x 10^4.)
                            </li>
                            <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long
                            you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you
                            think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

                            <h4>Exotic dance moves</h4>
                            <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I did study exotic tribal dances.
                                To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
                            <dl>
                                <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
                                <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. A whole
                                    village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock
                                    or be "fruitful".</dd>
                                <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
                                <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to
                                    practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the
                                    floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid
                                    movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired
                                    modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
                                <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
                                <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s
                                    believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted
                                    movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on,
                                    however, it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were
                                    really cold.</dd>
